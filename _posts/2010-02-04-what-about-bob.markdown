title: What About Bob?

I'm positively surprised of the warm reception my idea of [an XML-less build system][announcebob] got. I have already started working on something that might be called "a start", and I'm enthusiastic enough to say that I think I like what I have thus far.

So, [Bob][bob], as I'm calling the build thingy, has some code already, but not too much of that properly working kind. Unfortunately, it will stay like so for while. We have this campaign at work to create various stuff for [a thing called Directory][dirwire], and the campaign ends in a few weeks. Until that, I won't be touching Bob, since I'll be using all my spare inspiration and time on those other projects.

Nevertheless, once I pick Bob back up and have something interesting to show, I'll chime in with the news.
