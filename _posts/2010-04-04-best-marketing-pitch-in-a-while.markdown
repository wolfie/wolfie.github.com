summary: A short review of the book Rework
title: The Best Pitch in a Good While
---

Some people are astonished at how some people can stand for hours on end to queue for a two-hour commercial, presented by Steve Jobs. Well, I just finished reading 270-odd pages of advertisement for a workplace, and I will encourage you to do the same. No, it's not a position I found on Craigslist. It was the book [Rework][rework].

The book is written by the founders of [37signals][37s] ([their blog][37svn] is a highly recommended read, btw,) Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson. According to the introduction, it's a book about stuff they have found out to work in real business life. This would mean, what they talk about isn't some idealistic blabber; this would mean it's tried, it's doable, and it really works.

The book is a collection of 87 (hope I counted them right) pieces of wisdom. Each starts with a radical claim in the form of just a few words. Then they proceed to give a clear and concise explanation in just one or two pages on why it, indeed, is so. The language is down to earth, buzzword-free, friendly and convincing. It's CEO-level advice spoken with coffee-break-level words.

I found myself nodding to this book more than I tend to nod with Infected Mushroom's [Artillery][imvd]. I've been nodding either due to relief of not being alone with a thought (such as _Forget about formal education_,) due to obvious-to-me-ness (like _Marketing is not a department_,) or due to holy-shit moments (e.g. _Embrace constraints_.) There was not a single advice that I personally would disagree with. And almost all of them I would heartily welcome.

While the book is about 270 pages long, it's a very quick read, thanks to its easy langauge, large type and refreshing illustrations. A handful of hours is all it takes to read it from cover to cover. Although the book is written  primarily for business owners (current _or future_ ones), there are the occasional nuggets of gold that anyone can benefit from and try to make a difference (like _Meetings are toxic_.) There is absolutely no reason for anyone interested in a pleasant workplace not to read it. All the less reason for people wielding some corporate power. As [Seth Godin][sg] so fittingly puts it: _Ignore this book at your own peril_.

Rework has reminded me why I would never be happy working in a huge, multinational corporation. As it appears, this book stands for much that I, too, stand for. What the authors write about represents a workplace I would greatly enjoy being a part of.
