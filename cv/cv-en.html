		I&rsquo;m a computer nerd. My earliest memories of my life include a computer. Even before I started school, I was amazed by BASIC on the family-C64. I made endless variants of <code>GOTO</code> loops. While on first grade, I was already coding my first games in QBasic and Turbo Pascal.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Everything has its fascinating side, I believe, and I find interesting aspects of most things. I find learning new things easy, as long as I get to tinker with it on my own. I need to be able to poke at it, and see what comes out of the other end.
	</p>

	<p>
		I&rsquo;m fascinated and interested in all aspects of software development because I think of it as a craft. You plan something out, you carefully execute it and finally you can look back at what you have produced. You do dumb stuff, you learn from your mistakes, and finally you can look back at how much you've progressed.

			</div>
		</div>
		<p>
			I started out as a junior developer, coding on customer projects. After a while, I slowly moved towards UX/UI design. Not before long, the marketing team asked me to join them, and this is where I still am today. Some of the things I currently do are blogposts, manage people, update and maintain the company website and develop various pieces of software.
		</p>
		<p>
			In addition to work-related responsibilities, I organize the tri-annual company LAN party and I have also started a trading card game club.
		</p>
		<p>
			One could say that the only things I haven&rsquo;t done in this company is sales and administration.

			My first "real" job, in my mind. As a salesperson for Humac, an Apple retailer, I answered customers' questions, identified their <i>actual</i> needs and verified that the various solutions suited them and their needs.

		</div>
		<p>
			I installed servers (softwarewise), checked performance logs, filed problem reports and did other minor maintenance tasks. I was given strict instructions on how to perform certain tasks, and was not to divert from them. In general, it was  performing by-the-books and routine tasks.

		</div>
		<p>
			Turun Tietokuva is the photography department of Turun Sanomat, one of the largest newspapers in Finland. I worked as an on-call photographer: If they were short on personnel a certain day, I was called to work.
		</p>
		<p>
			This was practically a summer job: I didn't have one, so I just decided one day to take my bike, ride it around, and I took some photos from my surroundings. I then showed them to the head of photography and he hired me on the spot.

			</div>
		</div>
		<p>
			Satellite is probably the most ambitious, stressful and rewarding project I have been involved with. With a volunteer-personnel, about 40 heads strong, we were able to successfully host two commercial LAN parties in Turku, each bringing in about 150 paying customers. To my knowledge, Satellite was, and still holds the title of, the largest LAN party in Turku's history.
		</p>
		<p>
			I, with the help of my "lieutenants" as it were, identified what needed to be done, and delegated appropriate tasks to the appropriate people. If something fell through the cracks, I was responsible to catch them and make sure they became done, one way or another.
		</p>
		<p>
			Satellite was discontinued mainly due to a loss of the venue we used.

	<h2>Hobbies</h2>
	<p>
		I spend a lot of my free time in front of the home computer, playing <b>games</b>, <b>reading up on interesting stuff</b>, or <b>programming small pet projects</b>. I had <b>a Linux</b> server I maintained, but after a major malfunction, I have deprecated it.
	</p>
	<p>
		I have <b>two dogs</b> to entertain, and we sometimes go to the local race track for some lure coursing. I also have played several <b>musical instruments</b> (piano, violin, guitar), but those have been forgotten as time has passed. The same has happened to my <b>photography</b> hobby.
